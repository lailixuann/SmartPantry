283673,The Raffles Hotel Original Singapore Gin Sling Cocktail,"The Singapore Sling is one of those wonderful drinks that we probably have all heard of, but perhaps have never had. And because this recipe is often incorrectly recorded in most recipe books, even if you've think you've had it, you probably haven't.

One of the key, and often overlooked ingredients in this drink is Benedictine. While the resulting flavour is not overly predominate, it does add a certain taste profile that would be totally missing without this secret ingredient.

None dispute that the Singapore Sling was originally created by Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon for the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. However that is where the agreements end. The exact date is in question, with some people claiming it was in 1915, some 1913, while the hotel itself claims that it was created sometime prior to 1910. There is also plenty of disagreement as to how closely the current version of this drink that is served at Raffles is to what was originally served. Apparently the original recipe was lost and forgotten sometime in the 1930's, and the drink that they currently serve at the hotel's Long Bar (see recipe below) is based on memories of former bartenders, and some written notes that they were able to discover. Whatever the truth may be, this ""iconic"" drink is still enjoyed today, as much as it was back in the early 20th century! Maybe, the only way to really appreciate this cocktail, is to sip it slowly whilst sitting in a rattan chair, under the ceiling fans in the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel!","benedictine, bitters, cherry heering, cointreau liqueur, gin, grenadine, lime juice, pineapple juice","[""1 1/2  ounces    gin"",""1/2  ounce    cherry heering"",""1/4  ounce    Cointreau liqueur"",""1/4  ounce    benedictine"",""4   ounces    pineapple juice"",""1/2  ounce    lime juice"",""1/3  ounce    grenadine"",""1   dash    bitters""]",1 (180 g),1,"['Shake with ice.', 'Strain into an ice filled collins glass.', 'Garnish with cherry and slice of pineapple.', 'SINGAPORE SLING.', 'The Singapore Sling was created at Raffles Hotel at the turn-of-the-century by Hainanese-Chinese bartender, Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon.', ""In the Hotel's museum, visitors may view the safe in which Mr. Ngiam locked away his precious recipe books, as well as the Sling recipe hastily jotted on a bar-chit in 1936 by a visitor to the Hotel who asked the waiter for it."", ""Originally, the Singapore Sling was meant as a woman's drink, hence the attractive pink colour.

This ""secret"" recipe hails from one of the steamy kitchens in the vibrant Bo-Kaap area of Cape Town; it was on a recipe sheet given to my mum from a spice shop in that wonderful area, in the 1950's. The Bo-Kaap area is a treat; the houses are painted gorgeous bright colours that won't fail to make you smile, there are always children playing in the streets and the haunting call of the muezzin will remind you of exotic destinations such as Istanbul and Cairo. And then there's the smell of spices that wafts through open doorways and comes rushing out at you as you walk past Atlas Trading, the local spice emporium.

435730,Sayur Lodeh - Malaysian Vegetable Curry (Crock Pot),"One of my favorite Malaysian curries that I have adapted to use more commonly found ingredients here in the US and using the crock pot.  It has a delicate flavour and I make it barely spicy for my own tastes.  Ground dried shrimp can be found in Mexican markets or you can substitute with a teaspoon of fish sauce.  Authentic Sayur Lodeh uses a shrimp paste called belachan, Candle nuts are replaced with macadamia/cashews, and galangal with fresh ginger root.  Zucchini is not a vegetable commonly used in this curry but it works well with the flavours of this dish.","bay leaves, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower florets, coconut milk, coriander powder, dried chili pepper flakes, dried kaffir lime leaves, dried shrimp, fresh cilantro, fresh ginger, garlic cloves, green beans, lemon grass root, lime slice, macadamia nuts, onion, peanut oil, potatoes, salt, steamed rice, turmeric, water, zucchini","[""1       onion"",""5       garlic cloves"",""3       lemon grass root"",""3   inches    fresh ginger, root peeled "",""6       macadamia nuts or 6       cashews"",""1   teaspoon    coriander powder"",""1 1/2  tablespoons    turmeric"",""1 -2   teaspoon    salt"",""3       dried kaffir lime leaves"",""2       bay leaves"",""1/2  teaspoon    dried chili pepper flakes (to taste)"",""1   teaspoon    dried shrimp, ground "",""2       potatoes, peeled "",""2   cups    cabbage, chopped "",""2   cups    cauliflower florets"",""3       carrots, peeled "",""1       zucchini"",""1   cup    green beans"",""1 (14   ounce) can   coconut milk"",""1/4  cup    peanut oil"",""2   cups    water"",""  steamed rice"","""",""  fresh cilantro"",""  lime slice""]",1 (299 g),6,"['In a food processor chop together onion, garlic, lemon grass (white bottom part only), ginger, macadamia/cashew nuts into a coarse paste.', 'Cut potatoes, carrots, zucchini, green beans into 2"" chunks and set aside.', 'In a medium to large frying pan on the stove, add peanut oil and heat on high till very hot.

457422,Beef Rendang,"Excerpted from Cradle of Flavor: Home Cooking from the Spice Islands of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore by James Oseland 

This extravagantly rich, dry-braised beef curry is a signature dish of the Minangkabau highlands of West Sumatra, Indonesia. 
Allow plenty of time to make it. Rendang has its own lethargic cooking rhythm, so that the more you try to rush it, the longer it seems to take. Use a shallow, wide pan, such as a skillet, rather than a deep soup pot. Use the best-quality beef you can get. Choose boneless chuck or bottom round laced through with bright white fat and cut it into cubes yourself.

If you decide to use the maximum number of chiles this recipe calls for, you may need to use a standard-sized food processor, rather than a small one.","boneless beef chuck, candlenuts, cinnamon stick, fresh ginger, fresh lemongrass, galangal, garlic cloves, ground turmeric, kaffir lime leaves, kosher salt, red chilies, shallots, unsweetened coconut milk, whole cloves, whole nutmeg","[""1       whole nutmeg, cracked open with a heavy, blunt object "",""5       whole cloves"",""6       shallots, coarsely chopped  (about 5 ounces)"",""3       garlic cloves, coarsely chopped "",""5 -20       red chilies, stemmed and coarsely chopped "",""1 1/2  teaspoons    ground turmeric"",""2   tablespoons    fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced against the grain "",""2   tablespoons    galangal, peeled and thinly sliced against the grain "",""5       candlenuts or 5       unsalted macadamia nuts"",""2   lbs   well-marbled boneless beef chuck or 2   lbs    bottom round steaks, cut into 2- to 2 1/2-inch cubes "",""2 1/2  cups    unsweetened coconut milk"",""3   stalks    fresh lemongrass, each tied into a knot "",""1       cinnamon stick, 4 inches long "",""7      whole kaffir lime leaves"",""1   teaspoon    kosher salt""]",1 (310 g),4,"['To make the flavoring paste, place the nutmeg and cloves in a food processor and pulse until ground to a powder, about 2 minutes.', 'Add the shallots, garlic, chiles, turmeric, ginger, galangal (if using), and candlenuts to the ground spices.

Add the coconut milk, lemongrass, cinnamon, whole lime leaves, daun salam leaves (if using), and salt. Stir well and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered at a slow, steady bubble, stirring every 10 to 20 minutes. Adjust the heat periodically to maintain an even simmer.', 'At first, the broth will be thin and bright orange. As it cooks, it will become thicker and brown. Continue to simmer gently until the liquid has reduced by about 95 percent, stirring every 15 minutes or so to prevent sticking. Only the meat, oils, and a bit of thick sauce will remain. This will take 2 to 3 hours.', ""When all the liquid has evaporated, reduce the heat to low (the meat and the remaining sauce are prone to burning) and allow the beef to brown slowly.

The original color reflects the color of the yolks used in the making.
